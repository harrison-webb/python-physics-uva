# Efields

In this exercise you will develop basic visualizations of electrical fields

This is a group project.  Members of your group are listed by computing ID in our Piazza area under github_links.

Suggestions for team work:
* Teams can agree to meet by zoom to discuss projects participate in group coding work.
* Each member of the team can create a version of the notebook to check into git (eg notebook_UVaID.ipynb).  You can then compare notes after getting started on the exercies.
* Choose your best solution from the team's work and push the starter notebook(s) back to github with your solution before the deadlines.

For group projects fill out the following information in this README.nd

**Group number**:

**Computing Ids for team members**: 

Pledge for each team member: *I have participated in this project by writing code, discussing ideas and methods with my team mates, checking results, and/or actively learning or mentoring others.  I have not copied or provded full solutions for this project outside of my group.*

Team members sign here with your name:
* Harrison Webb (znk6fp)
* Joshua Smith (js5mv)
* Megan Lin (ml6cz)

Recommendation for working in groups.  Each student should first make a copy of the notebook, eg
```
    cp notebook_start.ipynb notebook_userID.ipynb
    git add notebook_userID.ipynb
    git commit -m "working copy"
    git push
```

Modify the copy "notebook_sol.ipynb" for your team's solution:

   
Work in your individual notebooks and collaborate to get the best results.
Copy your team's solution to ```notebook_sol.ipynb``` and push this one for review by the grader.
